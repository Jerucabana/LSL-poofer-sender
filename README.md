# LSL-poofer-sender
OpenSim multi texture particles poofer and sender.

To have your own emote poofer/sender, you need to create a HUD wuth two buttons and a controller that will be attached to your character.
The scripts named with HUD_ must be places each one on a button in your HUD.
The other three scripts go to your attachment.
Then you only need to add textures to your attachment (The name must not have spaces. At least, I didn't test that way).

If something goes wrong, don't hesitate to call Pandora Breyer at OpenSim.
